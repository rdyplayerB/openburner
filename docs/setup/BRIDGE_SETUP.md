# OpenBurner: HaLo Bridge Consent Required

Before the wallet can connect to your HaLo Bridge, you need to grant consent.

## Grant Consent

**Open this URL in your browser:**

```
http://127.0.0.1:32868/consent?website=http://localhost:3000
```

This will open the HaLo Bridge consent page where you can authorize localhost:3000 to use your bridge.

After granting consent, return to the wallet and try connecting again.

## Alternative: Check if consent page is needed

The bridge should automatically redirect you to the consent page when needed. If it doesn't, manually open the URL above.
