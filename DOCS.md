# OpenBurner Documentation

## What is Burner?

[Burner](https://burner.pro) is an affordable, credit-card-sized hardware wallet built for gifting and everyday crypto use. It uses the same secure chip technology found in traditional hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor, but reimagines the hardware wallet experience with a seedless design, web-based interface, and NFC connectivity. Burner combines the security of cold storage with the convenience of a software wallet, offering an accessible self-custody solution for spending, saving, and gifting crypto securely.

## What is OpenBurner?

OpenBurner is a wallet application for Burner Ethereum hardware wallets. It runs locally on your machine. Private keys remain in the card's secure element.

**Features:**
- Works with Burner Ethereum cards (EAL6+ secure element)
- Supports any EVM-compatible network
- Local execution only
- MIT licensed

### How is this different from BurnerOS?

**BurnerOS** is the official wallet from Burner that supports Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism.

**OpenBurner** is an alternative that:
- Supports all BurnerOS chains + many more (BNB Chain, Avalanche, Blast, Linea, Mantle, Mode, Polygon, Scroll, Unichain, etc.)
- Allows you to add any custom EVM-compatible chain
- Runs locally on your machine with full control over RPC endpoints
- Is open source (MIT licensed)

Both work with the same Burner Ethereum card - your addresses and keys remain the same.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Burner Card** - [Order here](https://arx-burner.myshopify.com/OPENBURNER)
- **Desktop NFC Reader** - ACR1252U or compatible USB reader ([Get on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3ISNwd7))
- **Node.js 18+**

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rdyplayerB/openburner.git
cd openburner
npm install
cp env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

### Gateway Mode Setup

1. Use your smartphone as an NFC reader
2. No additional software installation required
3. Scan QR code with your smartphone to connect

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 14+ (React framework)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Zustand (state management)

**Web3 Libraries:**
- ethers.js (blockchain interactions)
- libburner (Burner card communication via WebSocket)
- Multicall3 (efficient batch RPC calls)

**APIs:**
- CoinGecko API (token prices)
- Custom RPC endpoints (blockchain data)

## Architecture

┌──────────────────┐
│ Burner Ethereum  │  Secure element (EAL6+ certified)
│     Card         │  Stores private keys, signs transactions
└──────────────────┘
```

**Key Security Property**: Private keys never leave the Burner Ethereum card's secure element. Only public keys and signatures are exposed.

## How It Works

### 1. Connection
- Web app connects to HaLo Gateway via smartphone
- Gateway detects Burner Ethereum card via smartphone NFC
- App fetches Ethereum address from card's secure element

### 2. View Balances
- App queries blockchain RPCs for ETH and token balances
- Uses Multicall3 for efficient batch queries
- Fetches real-time prices from CoinGecko API

### 3. Send Transaction
- User enters recipient address and amount
- App builds unsigned transaction with ethers.js
- Transaction sent to Burner Ethereum card via gateway for signing
- Card signs transaction using private key (never exposed)
- Signed transaction broadcast to blockchain

## Key Code APIs

### Connect to Burner Ethereum Card

```typescript
import { getBurnerAddress } from '@/lib/burner';

const { address, publicKey, keySlot } = await getBurnerAddress();
```

### Sign Transaction

```typescript
import { signTransactionWithBurner } from '@/lib/burner';

const signedTx = await signTransactionWithBurner(unsignedTx, keySlot, pin);
await provider.broadcastTransaction(signedTx);
```

### Get Token Balances

```typescript
import { batchGetBalances } from '@/lib/multicall';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl);
const balances = await batchGetBalances(
  provider,
  tokenAddresses,
  walletAddress
);
```

### Get Token Prices

```typescript
import { getTokenPrices, clearPriceCache } from '@/lib/price-oracle';

const prices = await getTokenPrices([
  'ETH',
  'USDC'
]);
// Returns: { ETH: 2500.00, USDC: 1.00 }

// Force fresh price fetch
clearPriceCache();
```

**Price Caching Strategy:**

OpenBurner uses an aggressive multi-tier caching strategy to minimize CoinGecko API calls and stay within the free tier limits (10-30 calls/minute):

| Token Type | Cache Duration | Examples |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| Stablecoins | 2 hours | USDC, USDT, DAI |
| Major Tokens | 30 minutes | ETH, BTC, MATIC, BNB |
| Other Tokens | 30 minutes | All other tokens |

**Cache Layers:**
1. **Memory cache** - Fast, session-only
2. **localStorage** - Persistent across page reloads
3. **Request deduplication** - Prevents duplicate concurrent API calls
4. **Batch fetching** - All token prices fetched in single API call

**Manual Refresh Only:**
- Prices are **NOT** auto-refreshed on page load
- Cached prices are served immediately for instant UI
- Users must manually click the refresh button to update prices
- This prevents excessive API calls as user count scales

**Why This Matters:**
- With 100 tokens, 1 refresh = 1 API call (not 100)
- With 1000 users refreshing randomly across 1 hour = ~16 calls/min (sustainable)
- Free tier limit: 10-30 calls/minute
- If you need more frequent updates, consider upgrading to CoinGecko Pro

**UI Indicator:**
The token list shows "Updated Xm ago" next to the refresh button, so users know price freshness.

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Optional - CoinGecko API (free tier works without key)
NEXT_PUBLIC_COINGECKO_API_KEY=your_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_COINGECKO_API_URL=https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3
```

## Supported Networks

OpenBurner supports **everything BurnerOS does** (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism) **plus many more**:

- BNB Chain
- Avalanche
- Blast
- Linea
- Mantle
- Mode
- Polygon
- Scroll
- Unichain
- Any custom EVM-compatible chain

**How BurnerOS compares:**
- BurnerOS officially supports: Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism
- OpenBurner supports those + all additional EVM chains via custom RPC configuration

Add any custom network via the UI network selector.

## Token Management

### Default Token Lists

OpenBurner uses **streamlined token lists** focused on core tokens for optimal performance. The following essential tokens are pre-configured for each network:

**Ethereum Mainnet:**
- WETH, USDC, USDT, WBTC

**Base:**
- WETH, USDC, USD2

**Arbitrum One:**
- WETH, USDC, USDT, WBTC

**Optimism:**
- WETH, USDC, USDT, WBTC, OP

**Polygon:**
- POL (native), WETH, USDC, USDT, WBTC

**Blast:**
- WETH, USDB (native stablecoin)

**Scroll:**
- WETH, USDC, USDT

**Linea:**
- WETH, USDC, USDT

**zkSync Era:**
- WETH, USDC, USDT

### Adding Custom Tokens

**Important:** There is currently no token list service or UI for adding custom tokens. If you need to track tokens that aren't in the hardcoded lists above, you must:

1. Fork the repository
2. Edit `lib/token-lists.ts`
3. Add your token addresses to the appropriate chain ID
4. Rebuild and run your custom version

**Example** - Adding a custom token to Ethereum:

```typescript
// In lib/token-lists.ts
1: [
  { address: "0xYourTokenAddress", symbol: "TOKEN", name: "Your Token", decimals: 18 },
  // ... existing tokens
]
```

This limitation is intentional to keep the app simple and local-first. Future versions may include a dynamic token management UI.

## Gateway Connection (Hosted Version)

The hosted version uses smartphone-based NFC connections through the HaLo Gateway service.

### How It Works

1. **Gateway Service**: Uses `@arx-research/libhalo` for smartphone NFC communication
2. **QR Code Pairing**: Shows QR code for smartphone to scan and connect
3. **WebSocket Communication**: Communicates with smartphone via gateway
4. **Security**: Uses secure WebSocket connections and smartphone NFC

### Gateway Requirements

- **Smartphone with NFC**: Android or iOS device with NFC capability
- **Internet Connection**: Required for gateway communication
- **Burner Card**: Physical card to tap on smartphone
- **HaLo App**: Installed on smartphone for NFC communication

### Security Considerations

- Gateway communication uses secure WebSocket connections
- NFC communication is handled by smartphone's secure element
- No local software installation required
- Clear error handling for connection failures

## Security Notes

### What's Protected
✅ **Private keys** - Never leave the secure element chip  
✅ **Signing operations** - Happen inside hardware  
✅ **Key generation** - Done on-chip, not extractable

### What's Your Responsibility
⚠️ **Transaction verification** - Always verify recipient address and amount  
⚠️ **RPC endpoint trust** - Use trusted RPC providers  
⚠️ **Physical security** - Keep your Burner Ethereum card secure  
⚠️ **Bridge security** - Only run bridge on trusted local machine  
⚠️ **Local execution** - OpenBurner runs locally, not hosted anywhere

### Attack Surface
- **Web app** - Standard web vulnerabilities apply
- **RPC endpoints** - Could show false balances
- **Bridge** - Runs locally, only accessible on localhost
- **Chip** - Hardware tamper-resistant (EAL6+ certified)

## Troubleshooting

### Gateway won't connect
- Check internet connection is working
- Ensure smartphone has NFC enabled
- Try refreshing the page and scanning QR code again
- Check smartphone has HaLo app installed

### Can't read card
- Ensure Burner Ethereum card is properly positioned on smartphone
- Try removing and re-tapping card
- Check smartphone NFC is enabled
- Verify you have a Burner Ethereum card (not Bitcoin or other variants)

### Transaction fails
- Verify you have enough ETH for gas
- Check network is selected correctly
- Ensure RPC endpoint is responsive

## Development

```bash
# Run dev server
npm run dev
